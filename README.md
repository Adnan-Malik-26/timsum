## Installation

### User / Virtual Environment Installation (Recommended)

This method installs `timsum` in a local virtual environment, avoiding conflicts with system Python packages.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timsum.git
cd timsum

# Run the installation script
bash install.sh
```
After installation, ensure the install directory is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.timsum:$PATH"
```

You can add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to persist it.

System-Wide Installation (Optional)

Requires root privileges.
```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

This will install timsum to /usr/local/bin and install required Python packages system-wide.

## Usage
```bash

timsum [OPTIONS]
```
### Examples
```bash
timsum --theme mocha --range :week
timsum --theme latte --range :month
timsum --theme frappe --range :all
```

### Options
- --theme <theme>: Choose a theme for output (mocha, latte, frappe)

- --range <range>: Select a time range (:day, :week, :month, :all)

## Configuration

Currently, configuration is minimal and handled via CLI arguments.
Future versions may support a config file in ~/.timsum/config.toml with defaults for:
- Default theme
- Default time range
- Output format

## Development
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip` package manager

### Setup for Development
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timsum.git
cd timsum

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run Locally
```bash
python timew.py --theme mocha/frappe/machiatto/latte --range :all/:week/:day/:month
```
